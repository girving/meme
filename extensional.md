Extensional vs. intensional
===========================

Intensional advantages:

1. More decidable.
2. Mirrors fact that extensionally equal functions usually compare via pointer.
3. May have similar error message consequences as subtyping.

Extensional advantages:

1. (2) above is silly.
2. Makes more intuitive sense.
